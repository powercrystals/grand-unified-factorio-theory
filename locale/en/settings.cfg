[mod-setting-description]
guft-enableores-base=Iron, Copper, Stone, Coal, Crude Oil, and Uranium will spawn.
guft-enableores-base-preset=If not set to "All", restricts which base game ores can spawn based on the specified mod set's expectations.\n[img=info]Note that this can be manually replicated by unchecking resources in the map creation screen if desired, but selection here affects the Ore Overhaul feature for determining which ores are necessary in the spawn area.
guft-enableores-angel=Saphirite, Stiratite, etc. will spawn if Angel's mods are present.
guft-enableores-angelresource=Natural Gas Wells and Fissures will spawn if Angel's mods are present.
guft-enableores-bob=Cobaltite, Bauxite, Iron, etc. will spawn if Bob's mods are present.
guft-enableores-bobsulfur=Sulfur with spawn if Bob's mods are present.
guft-enableores-clown=Sanguinate, Adamantite, etc. will spawn if MadClown01's mods are present.
guft-enableores-clownresource=Alluvial Deposits, Oil Sands, etc. will spawn if MadClown01's mods are present.
guft-enableores-omni=Omnite will spawn if Omnimatter mods are present.
guft-enableores-py=Aluminum, Molybdenum, Borax, Regolites, etc., will spawn if Pyanodon's mods are present
guft-enableores-py-exact=If Pyanodon's Raw Ores is present and Pyanodon's ores are enabled above, this will disable coal and crude oil to match the way vanilla works
guft-enableores-yuoki=Durotal and Nuatreel will spawn if Yuoki's mods are present.

guft-newores-248k=Lithium will spawn directly if 248k is present.
guft-newores-angels=Chrome, Manganese, and Platinum, will spawn directly if Angel's mods are present.
guft-newores-angelsresource=Clay, Fluorite, Limestone, Salt, Sand, and Soil will spawn directly if Angel's mods are present.
guft-newores-clowns=Osmium, Magnesium, and Phosphorus will spawn directly if MadClown01's mods are present.
guft-newores-cargoships=guft will spawn deep sea oil and natural gas deposits if Cargo Ships is present.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]You should disable Cargo Ships' own oil spawning if this is enabled, or both will generate deep sea oil. Note that Cargo Ships will automatically disable its oil spawning if omnimatter is installed, but guft will still allow these to spawn if enabled here.

guft-newores-cargoships-oil-frequency=The frequency of deep sea oil patches (in % of water-only chunks).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.
guft-newores-cargoships-oil-richness=The richness of deep sea oil patches (in % of normal).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.
guft-newores-cargoships-gas-frequency=The frequency of deep sea natural gas patches (in % of water-only chunks).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships, Angel's Petrochem, and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.
guft-newores-cargoships-gas-richness=The richness of deep sea natural gas patches (in % of normal).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships, Angel's Petrochem, and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.
guft-newores-cargoships-fissure-frequency=The frequency of deep sea fissures (in % of water-only chunks).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships, Angel's Petrochem, and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.
guft-newores-cargoships-fissure-richness=The richness of deep sea fissures (in % of normal).\n[img=info]Needs Cargo Ships, Angel's Petrochem, and "Add Ores: Deep sea oil and natural gas" to have an effect.

guft-feature-belt-speeds=Adjusts the speed of belts to try to provide a consistent but non-linear progression. Will override the equivalent settings in Bob's Logistics, but will make use of the "basic"/"white" belts that mod provides if they are present. The intent is to make later tier belt upgrades as impressive as early upgrades, rather than going from say 60 to 75 which is not a significant increase.
guft-feature-bio-speed-changes=Greatly increases speed of most biological processes to reduce the number of facilities needed (and improve UPS).
guft-feature-equipment=Will update known armors, vehicles, and equipment to unify their functions and grid sizes.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]Note that this may result in equipment unknown to GUFT not being usable, as well as potentially resizing existing grids.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]It is recommended you remove any equipment from any armor you are using before enabling this.
guft-feature-equipment-angel-vehicle-equipment=If both Angel's and Bob's equipment are enabled, Angel's is more powerful to the point of rendering some of Bob's obsolete. This allows you to decide if the equipment should be included unchanged ("As-Is"), rebalanced to be more in line with Bob's ("Rebalanced"), or not at all ("Not Included").
guft-feature-equipment-player-equipment-in-vehicles=Allow player equipment to be used in vehicles. Recommended on if not playing with a mod that adds vehicle equipment (such as Bob's Vehicle Equipment) to enable vehicle shields etc. Requires equipment and grid overhaul above to function.
guft-feature-hand-craft-filter=Recipes that cannot be crafted by hand (by category or by involving a fluid) will not be visible in the hand crafting menu. They can still be selected in machines. This can make it easier to find recipes when you know what you're looking for, but may make discovery of new recipes more difficult.\n[img=info]A recipe book mod like FNEI is recommended if you enable this.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]Not all recipes seem to respect being hidden from the hand craft menu. I have yet to figure out why.
guft-feature-magic-barrels=Barrel and barrel-like items (like Bob's gas cylinders and canisters) no longer consume empty containers when producing filled containers, nor does emptying produce empty containers. This can make certain logistical aspects much easier if you don't enjoy that part of the game.
guft-feature-miner-area=Reduce miner area from 5x5 to 3x3, which can make designs more compact when ores overlap but will reduce how many mines can be placed on the edge of a patch.
guft-feature-ore-control=Override all supported ore spawn with custom rates etc. This will attempt to create a more useful rate of ore spawns, with ores that are needed in smaller quantities being rarer and harder to find.\nThis allows some manual control over what ores show up in the starting area (see below): if for example you're using both Angel's and Bob's ores but only want Bob's ores in the starting area, you can set that. Enabling a starting ore that isn't otherwise available has no effect. Note that Factorio's starting area ore placement is somewhat unpredictable in the first place, and enabling an ore here only guarantees that the game will try to place it, not that it will succeed.
guft-feature-ore-control-rarity=Typical ore spawn rate will be multiplied by this value. Set lower for less frequent ores. Requires Ore spawn logic replacement above to be enabled. Very small values may lead to ores being difficult to impossible to find (beware enemy base density!). Very large values may impact worldgen performance.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-base-coal=Include base-game coal in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-base-stone=Include base-game stone in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-base-metals=Include base-game iron ore and copper ore in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-angel=Include Angel's starting compound ores (Saphirite, Stiratite, Rubyite, and Bobmonium) in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-bob=Include Bob's starting ores (tin, quartz, and lead) in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-omni=Include Omnite in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-py=Include Py's starting resources (tin, quartz, led, and raw coal) in the starting area.
guft-feature-ore-control-start-yuoki=Include Yuoki's ores (N4 and F7) in the starting area.
guft-feature-productivity=Enable productivity for recipes that should have had it, as well as make Angel's agricultural modules work in appropriate Bio Industries and Yuoki Industries buildings.
guft-feature-radar-range=Increases radar max scan range significantly and slightly increases max vision range. May be especially beneficial if playing with rare resource deposits.
guft-feature-unicomp=Will replace existing Yuoki unicomp conversions with lossy ones that consume refined resources to produce raws. Adds support for conversions to other mods' resources where appropriate.

guft-balance-swap-angel-gems-crystals=Makes modules cost gems instead of crystals. Beacons still require crystals.
guft-balance-aai-cost=Increases the raw cost of AAI vehicles and their technologies.\n[img=info]Overall this makes all vehicles after the Chaingunner more expensive. Requires Bob's mods.
guft-balance-bob-equipment-no-artifacts=Removes artifacts from personal/vehicle equipment that normally requires them.
guft-balance-angel-ore-sort-multiplier=Changes the amount of ore received per operation at each structure that turns Angel/Clown ores (or their processed stages) into sorted ores. Will also increase yield of waste such as slag or acids.
guft-balance-easy-nitrogen-dioxide=Adds a recipe to create Nitrogen Dioxide directly from Nitrogen and Oxygen.

guft-misc-early-logistics=Changes Logistics Requester Chests to unlock with Logisitcs Robotics instead of Logistics System. This allows them to be unlocked without Utility science packs, allowing the use of logistics robots earlier in the game. Has no effect if Angel's Industries is installed, which does something similar.
guft-misc-fragile-burners=Burner mining drills and burner inserters return their components when mined instead of the entity itself. This allows you to reclaim the resources as normally these are not used in any other recipes.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]Due to technical limitations this will always use the "normal" cost for the refund, not the "expensive" recipe, even if your save is set to expensive mode.
guft-misc-no-omnic-water=By default, Omnimatter changes offshore and ground water pumps to produce Omnic Water instead of regular water. This undoes that.
guft-misc-yuoki-trains-chemical-fuel=Allow Yuoki locomotives to run on chemical fuel (coal, wood, etc.) regardless of tier.\n[img=info]Yuoki Diesel/Future trains will still accept their normal fuel types as well.
guft-misc-angel-basic-smelting=Angel's Smelting disables e.g. using iron ore directly in a furnace, requiring either crushing Saphirite or going through a blast furnace. This will reenable the original smelting recipes. Affects Iron, Copper, Lead, and Tin.

guft-mores-enable=Traditionally-finite ores will be set to a very large richness (technically finite, but not in any typical playthrough). Traditionally-infinite ores will be set to not deplete over time.

guft-debug-logging=Affects the detail guft will log. 0 (Off) by default.\n[img=utility.warning_icon]This setting is typically hidden.
